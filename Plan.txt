Goal
Sometimes people feed their pets late so I want to make an app that has an alarm that rings at a set time.

Challenges

-how will they be reminded (ex. noise from the computer, text, email)
-will we send it to the phone or computer, etc.
-how to keep track of time
-what time should the user be reminded

Solutions

- use time library
- send notifications to phone with pushover
	-says "FEED LOUIE NOW...OR ELSE"
